      "On August 30, 2023, two impressive sunsets were observed in South America and Vietnam. This phenomenon resembles a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering,\" where sunlight scatters in the atmosphere due to interactions with molecules and small particles. In this case, high cirrus clouds composed of tiny ice crystals act as surfaces for light scattering. This process results in the sky taking on an orange-red hue during sunset, creating a captivating spectacle. However, the colors of the sunset can also depend on other factors, such as the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere, which can enhance or alter the sunset's colors.\n",

However, by 2023, the frequency of such eruptions had decreased, with the last major eruption occurring on June 9th. Yesterday, after more than two months, another significant eruption took place.
