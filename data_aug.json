Typically, Strombolian activity is observed here, and sometimes phases of intense lava flow, creating high ash plumes and dangerous pyroclastic flows. As of today, October 10, 2023, explosive activity continues. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) in Washington has warned of a volcanic ash plume that has risen to an altitude of approximately 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) at 13:51 UTC.\n\nFollow us on social media:\nInstagram - shorturl.at/fkpZ9\nFacebook - shorturl.at/guBH2\nCreative Society - www.creativesociety.com",

Streets, shopping centers, and metro stations have been submerged, forcing authorities to take urgent measures: schools are closed, and workers have been advised to stay at home. \n\nFor the first time in 140 years of recorded observations in this area, the highest amount of rainfall ever has been recorded. Water literally cascaded down the hilly terrain of the city, prompting authorities to issue warnings of possible landslides. The tunnel connecting Hong Kong Island and Kowloon through the harbor has also been flooded.\n\nThe local meteorological bureau has issued the highest level of storm warning, 'black,' citing over 200 mm of rainfall on the main islands of Hong Kong and Kowloon.\n\nInstagram - shorturl.at/fkpZ9\nCreative Society - www.creativesociety.com",

This unusual phenomenon occurred in the village of Chakyr in the Churapchinsky Ulus and has already become a point of interest for local residents. They decided to investigate it and discovered that a glacier had emerged from beneath the ground. As a result, a small crater has formed, collecting thawed water.\n\nScientists had previously warned that further increases in air temperature would lead to active permafrost thawing. Consequently, the soil would begin to collapse, and ice would surface in some areas. It's essential to consider that Yakutia is home to several major cities where houses were built using piles. If permafrost starts to thaw, it could pose a threat to their stability.\n\nFollow us on social media:\nInstagram - shorturl.at/fkpZ9\nFacebook - shorturl.at/guBH2",
